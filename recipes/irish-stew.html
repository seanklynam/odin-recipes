    <h2>Classic recipe for Ireland's most iconic one-pot dish</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1.25 kg beef chuck</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp each salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>180g bacon</li>
        <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>440ml Guinness</li>
        <li>4 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>750 ml chicken stock/broth</li>
        <li>3 carrots</li>
        <li>2 large celery stalks</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>3 sprigs thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the beef into 5cm chunks. Pat dry then sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy based pot over high heat. Add beef in batches and brown well all over. Remove onto plate. Repeat with remaining beef.</li>
        <li>Lower heat to medium. If the pot is looking dry, add oil.</li>
        <li>Cook garlic and onion for 3 minutes until softening, then add bacon.</li>
        <li>Cook until bacon is browned, then stir through carrot and celery. </li>
        <li>Add flour, and stir for 1 minute to cook off the flour.</li>
        <li>Add Guinness, chicken broth/stock and tomato paste. Mix well (to ensure flour dissolves well), add bay leaves and thyme. </li>
        <li>Return beef into the pot (including any juices). Liquid level should just cover - see video or photos.</li>
        <li>Cover, lower heat so it is bubbling gently. Cook for 2 hours - the beef should be pretty tender by now. Remove lid then simmer for a further 30 - 45 minutes or until the beef falls apart at a touch, the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly.</li>
        <li>Skim off fat on surface, if desired. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Remove bay leaves and thyme.</li>
        <li>Serve with creamy mashed potatoes!!</li>
    </ol>
